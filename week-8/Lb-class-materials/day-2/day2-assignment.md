## Day 2 Assignment: SCSS Modularization

### Objective

Develop a dashboard page for the `sassy-blog` project, applying SCSS modularization techniques. Focus on creating a functional, well-styled dashboard that complements the existing splash page.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Setup and Planning

- **Create a New HTML Page**:
  - Add a new HTML file named `dashboard.html` to your `sassy-blog` repository.
  - Plan the layout for the dashboard. It could include sections like recent posts, blog statistics, or a content management area.

#### Part 2: SCSS Modularization

- **Expand Your SCSS Structure**:
  - Create SCSS partials specific to the dashboard, such as `_dashboard-layout.scss`, `_widgets.scss`, or `_navigation.scss`.
  - Continue using and expanding the existing SCSS partials like `_variables.scss` and `_typography.scss` for consistent styling.

#### Part 3: Building the Dashboard

- **Develop the Dashboard HTML**:

  - Structure your `dashboard.html` with appropriate HTML5 semantic elements.
  - Include navigation to move between the splash page and the dashboard.

- **Style the Dashboard with SCSS**:
  - Utilize your SCSS partials to style the dashboard.
  - Focus on creating a user-friendly, visually appealing interface.

#### Part 4: Testing and Enhancements

- **Ensure Responsiveness**:
  - Make sure the dashboard is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
  - Test and adjust styles for consistency and usability.

#### Part 5: Deployment and Submission

- **Deploy Your Updated Project**:

  - Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
  - Deploy the updated `sassy-blog` project, including the new dashboard page.

- **Submit Your Assignment**:
  - Provide the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live deployment.
  - Ensure both the splash page and the new dashboard page are accessible.
