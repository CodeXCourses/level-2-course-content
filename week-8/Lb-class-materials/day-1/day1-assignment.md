## Assignment: SCSS Basics

### Objective

Design and develop a splash page for a blog site using HTML and SCSS. Focus on applying SCSS features like variables and nesting, and use BEM methodology for class naming.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Setup Your Project

- **Create a New Repository**:
  - Name your repository `sassy-blog`.
  - Initialize it with `index.html`, `styles.scss`, and optionally `styles.css` (compiled from SCSS).

#### Part 2: Design the Splash Page

- **Create HTML Structure**:
  - In `index.html`, design a basic layout for your blog's splash page, including a header, main content area, and footer.

#### Part 3: Implement SCSS Styling

- **Define SCSS Variables**:

  - In `styles.scss`, define variables for at least three colors and other reusable properties like fonts or padding.

- **Apply BEM Methodology**:

  - Use BEM naming conventions to create meaningful class names for your HTML elements.

- **Use SCSS Features**:
  - Implement SCSS nesting to structure your stylesheet mirroring the HTML structure.
  - Utilize the defined SCSS variables throughout your stylesheet.

#### Part 4: Compiling SCSS to CSS

- **Compile SCSS**:
  - Use a tool or an extension (like Live Sass Compiler) to compile your `styles.scss` to `styles.css`.
  - Link the compiled CSS file in your `index.html`.

#### Part 5: Finalizing the Splash Page

- **Style Your Splash Page**:
  - Ensure that your splash page is visually appealing and utilizes SCSS features effectively.
  - Pay attention to details like spacing, alignment, and responsiveness.

#### Part 6: Deployment and Submission

- **Deploy Your Splash Page**:
  - Push your code to GitHub and deploy your project using GitHub Pages or a similar service.
- **Submit Your Assignment**:
  - Provide the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live deployment as your assignment submission.

### Rubric

#### SCSS Implementation and BEM Methodology - /10

- Complete (10 pts): Effective use of SCSS features with adherence to BEM methodology. The splash page is styled coherently with a clear SCSS structure.
- Partial (5 pts): Basic use of SCSS and BEM with some areas lacking in consistency or structure.
- Limited (0 pts): Inadequate implementation of SCSS or BEM, or the page lacks coherent styling.

#### Design and Aesthetics - /5

- Complete (5 pts): The splash page is visually appealing, with attention to design elements and user experience.
- Partial (2 pts): The splash page has a basic design with minimal styling and aesthetic appeal.
- Limited (0 pts): The page lacks in design, with poor aesthetics or usability issues.

#### Code Quality and Documentation - /5

- Complete (5 pts): The code is well-organized, efficiently structured, and well-commented. The SCSS file demonstrates good use of features.
- Partial (2 pts): The code functions but may lack organization, efficiency, or sufficient comments.
- Limited (0 pts): The code is poorly organized, inefficient, or lacks comments.
