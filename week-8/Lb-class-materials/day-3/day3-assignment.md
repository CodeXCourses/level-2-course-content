## Day 3 Assignment: Mixins

### Objective

Enhance the `sassy-blog` dashboard by creating and using specific Sass Mixins. This assignment focuses on practical applications of Mixins to improve style reuse and consistency.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Creating Specific Mixins

- **Create a Flexbox Mixin**:

  - Define a Mixin named `flex-layout` that sets up a flex container. Include parameters for `justify-content` and `align-items` with default values.

- **Create a Button Mixin**:

  - Define a Mixin named `button-style`. It should include parameters for background color, text color, and border radius.

- **Create a Typography Mixin**:
  - Define a Mixin named `font-style` that applies font-family, font-size, and line-height. Allow these to be passed as parameters.

#### Part 2: Applying Mixins in Dashboard Styles

- **Refactor Flexbox Styles**:

  - Apply the `flex-layout` Mixin to all flex containers on your dashboard page.

- **Style Buttons with Mixin**:

  - Use the `button-style` Mixin to style different buttons on the dashboard. Create at least two variations by passing different arguments.

- **Implement Typography Mixin**:
  - Use the `font-style` Mixin for headings and text content, demonstrating at least two different uses.

#### Part 3: Enhance and Test Dashboard Page

- **Further Style Refinement**:

  - Beyond using Mixins, refine other styles on your dashboard for a cohesive look.

- **Test for Responsiveness and Consistency**:
  - Ensure that the dashboard is responsive and maintains consistent styling.

#### Part 4: Deployment and Submission

- **Deploy Updated Dashboard**:
  - Push your changes and deploy the updated `sassy-blog` project.
- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Provide the link to your GitHub repository and live deployment.
  - Ensure your submission clearly demonstrates the use of specified Mixins.
