# Week 8: Capstone Project

## Overview

This week is dedicated to the development of a capstone project. Students will be placed in breakout rooms, and instructors will facilitate stand-ups, provide feedback, and assist with any blockers. The week will culminate in final project presentations and peer reviews.

## Objectives

- Plan and build a comprehensive web application.
- Implement a chat interface using the Gemini API.
- Present the final project and participate in peer reviews.

## Instructor Notes

### Breakout Rooms and Stand-Ups

- Place students in breakout rooms at the beginning of each session.
- Move from room to room, conducting stand-ups with the following structure:
  - Ask each student what they worked on since the last session.
  - Identify any blockers they are facing.
  - Have students share their screens to show their progress.
  - Provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- For large groups, divide students into groups of 5:
  - Select one volunteer to share their work and receive feedback.
  - Encourage other group members to ask questions and share any blockers they are facing.
