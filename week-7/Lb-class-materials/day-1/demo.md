### Hour 1: Review of Command Line Basics

#### Introduction to Unix/Linux Commands

1. **Change Directory - `cd`**:

   - Command: `cd <directory_path>`
   - Say: "The `cd` command changes the current directory. For example, `cd Documents` moves you into the Documents directory."

2. **List Files - `ls`**:

   - Command: `ls`
   - Say: "The `ls` command lists all files and folders in the current directory."

3. **List All Files - `ls -a`**:

   - Command: `ls -a`
   - Say: "Adding `-a` option to `ls`, as in `ls -a`, includes hidden files (those starting with a dot) in the list."

4. **Print Working Directory - `pwd`**:

   - Command: `pwd`
   - Say: "The `pwd` command prints the current directory you are in."

5. **Make Directory - `mkdir`**:

   - Command: `mkdir <new_directory_name>`
   - Say: "Use `mkdir` to create a new directory, for example, `mkdir NewFolder`."

6. **Create a New File - `touch`**:

   - Command: `touch <new_file_name>`
   - Say: "The `touch` command creates a new file. For instance, `touch example.txt` creates an empty text file named example."

7. **Move or Rename Files - `mv`**:

   - Command: `mv <original_file_name> <new_file_name_or_path>`
   - Say: "The `mv` command moves or renames files. To rename, `mv old.txt new.txt`. To move, `mv example.txt Documents/`."

8. **Copy Files - `cp`**:
   - Command: `cp <source_file_name> <destination_file_name_or_path>`
   - Say: "The `cp` command copies files. For example, `cp source.txt destination.txt` copies source.txt to destination.txt."

#### Practical Exercises

1. **Navigate Directories**:

   - Exercise: Move to different directories using `cd`.
   - Say: "Let's practice changing directories. Try `cd ..` to go up one level."

2. **Create Files and Directories**:

   - Exercise: Use `mkdir` to create a directory and `touch` to create a file.
   - Say: "Now, create a new directory named 'Test' and inside it, create a file named 'test.txt'."

3. **Manipulate File Structure**:

   - Exercise: Rename and move the created file using `mv`.
   - Say: "Rename 'test.txt' to 'example.txt' and then move it to the parent directory."

4. **Copy Files**:
   - Exercise: Create a copy of a file in a different directory using `cp`.
   - Say: "Copy 'example.txt' back into the 'Test' directory with a new name 'copy.txt'."

### Hour 2: Configuring and Initializing Git

#### Introduction to `git init`

1. **Initializing a Repository**:

   - Command: `git init`
   - Say: "The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository. It creates a new `.git` directory in your project, which Git uses to track changes."

2. **Creating a Sample Project**:
   - Exercise: Make a new directory and initialize Git.
   - Say: "Let's create a new folder named 'GitDemo' using `mkdir GitDemo`, navigate into it with `cd GitDemo`, and then run `git init`."

#### Configuring Git

1. **Setting Username and Email**:

   - Command: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`, `git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"`
   - Say: "Configure your Git username and email, which Git uses to identify the author of commits. Replace with your details."

2. **Authentication**:
   - Say: "For authentication, especially when pushing to remote repositories like GitHub, you'll need to set up SSH keys or use HTTPS with your credentials."

#### Understanding Staging and the ACP Workflow

1. **What is Staging?**:

   - Say: "Staging is a step before the commit process in Git. It's where you prepare and organize your changes before committing them to the repository's history."

2. **The `git add` Command**:

   - Exercise: Create a few files with `touch file1.txt file2.txt` and stage them.
   - Say: "The `git add` command adds changes to the staging area. Use `git add .` to add all changes, or `git add <file>` for specific files."

3. **Staging from Different Folders**:

   - Exercise: Create files in different subfolders and use `git add .` from various levels.
   - Say: "Running `git add .` stages changes in the current directory and its subdirectories. Let's try this by creating files in different folders."

4. **Committing Changes**:

   - Command: `git commit -m "Commit message"`
   - Say: "Once changes are staged, use `git commit` to save them to your repository's history. The `-m` flag lets you add a commit message."

5. **Git Push**:
   - Command: `git push origin main`
   - Say: "The `git push` command uploads your committed changes to a remote repository. You'll specify the remote name (usually 'origin') and the branch."

#### Practicing ACP Workflow

1. **Adding Content to Files**:

   - Note: Use VS Code or a text editor to add content to the created files.
   - Say: "Let's add some text to our files using a text editor before we add and commit them."

2. **Add, Commit, Push Exercise**:
   - Exercise: Practice the full ACP workflow by adding, committing, and pushing changes.
   - Say: "Add the files to staging, commit them with a meaningful message, and then push to a remote repository if set up."

#### Conclusion

- Summarize: "Today, we've reviewed how to initialize a Git repository, configure our Git settings, and understand the crucial staging area. We also practiced the ACP workflow, which is fundamental for effective version control."
