# JavaScript Topics

This week is a good one to review JS topics in a new context.

List of topics to review in the context of DevTools

* for-loops
* if-statement branching (set break on both if and else branch to see what happens)
* code in the global scope (breakpoint gets caught on load)
* callback functions (breakpoint gets caught when button clicks)
* global scope variables
* function scope variables
* block scope variables (let and const)
* shadow variables (same name in and outside of a scope)
* objects and properties
* null and undefined types
* function arguments
* function return values
