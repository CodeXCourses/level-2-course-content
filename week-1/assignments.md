# Assignments for Week 1 DevTools 2

## Day 1

Create a repository with several errors in it.

1. Create a new repository on GitHub called "Garden-of-Errors".
2. Add a README. In the README, explain that there will be several errors intentionally added to the code.
3. Add three img tags whose src attribute is wrong (For example, misspelled.)
4. In the readme, say what the error for invalid img tags is.
5. Add a link tag to a css file that doesn't exist.
6. In the README File, say what the error is.
7. Add a js file called `errors.js`
8. In the `errors.js` file add at least one JavaScript error.

* Bonus: create another file called `syntax-errors.js`. Make one syntax error and run it. Add that to your README. Make a second syntax error. Do you see both errors or only one? Why do you think this is?
* Create another file called `syntax-errors-2.js` make different error so that it shows in the DevTools.
* Make a few more JavaScript files, each with one syntax error. Add these to the README.

## Day 2

Continue with your repository from Day 1.

You will create some for-loops and if-statements. Set breakpoints and take screenshots of each one and add them to the README.

Add a function with variables defined within the function block. Set breakpoints and add

Remember to commit after each step.

1. Create a file called `for-loops.js` and `for-loops.html`.
2. Create an array and a for-loop to loop through the array. (The array can of any type and any length you like. The for loop can do whatever you want.)
3. Set a breakpoint inside the for-loop. Take a screenshot and add it to the README file.
4. Make two more arrays and for-loops. Set breakpoints on them and observe in the DevTools. (You don't need to screenshot this time.)
5. Create a file called `if.js` and a file called `if.html`
6. Create an if-statement in the js file.
7. Set a breakpoint inside the code block of the if-statement. Take a screenshot and add it to the README file.
8. Create a file called `function.js` and a file called `function.html`
9. Create a function in the js file.
10. Set a breakpoint inside the code block of the function. Take a screenshot and add it to the README file.
