# Week 1: Day 1 Assignment - Mastering JavaScript Debugging

## Objective

Develop essential debugging skills in JavaScript using Chrome DevTools and enhance problem-solving abilities through a practical exercise.

## Instructions

This assignment involves cloning a starter code from a GitHub repository, identifying and fixing errors, and pushing the corrected code to a new repository. The focus is on using `console.log` and `console.error` to find and understand common JavaScript errors.

### Part 1: Setting up the Project

- **Clone the Starter Code**:

  - Clone the repository from `https://github.com/codex-demos/devtools-day1.git` to your local machine.

- **Create Your Repository**:

  - On GitHub, create a new repository named `Devtools-debugging`.
  - Initialize this repository with a `README.md` file.
  - Clone your new repository to your local machine.

- **Copy the Starter Code**:
  - Copy the files from the cloned `devtools-day1` repository into your `Devtools-debugging` repository.

### Part 2: Debugging Exercise

- **Identify and Fix Errors**:

  - Open the starter files in your preferred code editor.
  - Start debugging each error using `console.log` or `console.error`.
  - Some errors are non-fixable; in those cases, leave a detailed comment explaining why the error can't be fixed.

- **Commit and Push Your Changes**:
  - Commit your changes regularly with clear and descriptive messages.
  - Once all errors are addressed, push the changes to your `Devtools-debugging` repository on GitHub.

### Part 3: Submission

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Make sure your `Devtools-debugging` repository on GitHub contains the final corrected code and any additional comments.
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository as your assignment submission.
