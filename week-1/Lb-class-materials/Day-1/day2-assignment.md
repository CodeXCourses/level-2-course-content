# Week 1: Day 2 Assignment - Advanced JavaScript Debugging

## Objective

Refine JavaScript debugging skills using Chrome DevTools, focusing on setting and using breakpoints to capture and analyze runtime data.

## Instructions

This assignment continues from where you left off in your `Devtools-debugging` repository from Day 1. You will interact with a deployed website, use DevTools to capture secret messages, and record your findings. The challenge involves setting breakpoints effectively and understanding the flow of asynchronous JavaScript code.

### Part 1: Interacting with the Deployed Site

- **Visit the Website**:

  - Go to `https://codex-demos.github.io/devtools-day2/`.
  - This website has a script that fetches secret messages based on specific tasks.

### Part 2: Debugging Exercise

- **Capture Secret Messages**:

  - Open Chrome DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+I` or `Cmd+Option+I`) and navigate to the "Sources" tab.
  - Locate the `script.js` file and set breakpoints at the lines where `fetchSecretMessage` function is called.
  - Capture the secret message for each task when the breakpoint is hit. There are 10 secret messages in total, corresponding to tasks 1-10.

- **Record Your Findings**:

  - In your `Devtools-debugging` repository, create a new file named `Day-2.md`.
  - Document each secret message and its corresponding task in the format below:

    ```
    - 'task-1': 'Secret Message for Task 1',
    - 'task-2': 'Secret Message for Task 2',
    ...
    - 'task-10': 'Secret Message for Task 10',
    ```

### Part 3: Submission

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Ensure that your `Day-2.md` file in the `Devtools-debugging` repository contains all the captured secret messages.
  - Submit the URL link to your `Day-2.md` file in the repository as your assignment submission.
