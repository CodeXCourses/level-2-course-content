# Week 1: Day 4 Assignment - Web Performance Optimization

## Objective

Enhance your web optimization skills using Chrome DevTools. You will analyze and improve the performance of your capstone project, focusing on areas highlighted by Lighthouse, and dive deeper into performance profiling and network analysis.

## Instructions

Continue using your `Devtools-debugging` repository. Today's assignment involves analyzing your capstone project's web performance using various Chrome DevTools features.

### Part 1: Lighthouse Audit

- **Run a Lighthouse Audit**:
  - Use Chrome DevTools to run a Lighthouse audit on the main page of your capstone project.
  - Capture a screenshot of the Lighthouse report.
  - Identify areas with low scores (below 80) and list them in your report.

### Part 2: Performance Profiling and Network Analysis

#### Performance Profiling

- **Record and Analyze Performance**:
  - Open the Performance tab in DevTools.
  - Record a performance profile while interacting with your site.
  - Identify any significant issues, such as long tasks, layout shifts, or heavy scripting.
  - Capture a screenshot of the performance profile.
  - Propose optimizations based on your findings.

#### Network Analysis

- **Examine Network Activity**:
  - Switch to the Network tab in DevTools.
  - Reload your site and analyze the network activity.
  - Identify resources that are large in size or take a long time to load (e.g., images, scripts, CSS files).
  - Capture a screenshot of the network activity panel.
  - Suggest ways to optimize these resources.

### Part 3: Documentation and Submission

- **Compile Your Report**:

  - Create a new Markdown file named `Day-4.md` in your `Devtools-debugging` repository.
  - Include the following:
    - Screenshots from the Lighthouse audit.
    - Screenshots from the Performance and Network tabs.
    - A list of identified issues and proposed optimizations.
    - A reflective summary of what you learned and how you could apply these optimizations.

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Ensure your `Day-4.md` file is complete with all required screenshots and documentation.
  - Submit the URL link to your `Day-4.md` file as your assignment submission.
