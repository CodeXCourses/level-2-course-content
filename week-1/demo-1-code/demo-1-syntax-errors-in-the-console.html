  <h1>Examples of syntax errors.</h1>
  <p>Some errors are syntax errors. They can stop you code even before any of it runs. The good thing about them is that VSCode can help you find them.</p>

  <h2 id="example-1">Example 1: Unexpected Token</h2>
  <p>In computer science, a "token" is a character or word. This error is saying that you a missing a character in your code. In this case, an opening parenthesis. 
  </p>
  <p>Open the dev tools to see this. Try fixing it to go on the the next one.</p>

  <h2 id="example-2">Example 2: Unexpected end of output</h2>
  <p></p>

  <p>If you forget to close a bracket or a quotation mark, you'll get an "unexpected end of output" error. Why? Because it expects a closing character, but it never get one!</p>
