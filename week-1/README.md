# Level 2 Front-End Web Development

## Week 1: Chrome Dev Tools Developer 2

### Overview:
This week delves into advanced functionalities of the Google Chrome Developer Tools. By week's end, participants will be adept at utilizing console errors for debugging, setting breakpoints, and distinguishing between global and function scopes.

It will also be a place to review JavaScript concepts like variables, code blocks, if-statements, and loops. Students will not be completely comfortable with these concepts, and some may be having trouble understanding them. Having a week to discuss these topics and now being able to step though code should help.

### Detailed Daily Breakdown:

### Day 1: Refresher & Introduction to Advanced Debugging
- **Review Session:** A brief revisit of the fundamentals of Chrome Dev Tools from Level 1.
- **Introduction:** Set the stage for the advanced topics to be covered throughout the week.
- **Hands-on:** Begin with understanding how console errors can pinpoint JavaScript bugs.

### Day 2: Breakpoints & Debugging
- **Deep Dive:** Understand the concept of breakpoints in JavaScript debugging.
- **Hands-on Activity:** Set, watch, and manage breakpoints in JavaScript code using Dev Tools.

### Day 3: Conditional Breakpoints
- **Exploration:** Dive into the utility and application of conditional breakpoints.
- **Activity:** Practice setting conditional breakpoints and understand their triggering conditions.

### Day 4: Scope in Debugging
- **Theory:** Introduction to global and function scopes in the context of debugging.
- **Hands-on:** Demonstrate the difference between breakpoints in global scope and in function scope.

### Day 5: Capstone Activities & Wrap-Up
- **Activity:** Engage in real-world debugging scenarios, consolidating the week's learning.
- **Discussion:** Share insights, hurdles faced, and solutions discovered during hands-on sessions.
- **Wrap-Up:** Summarize the week's lessons and set the stage for the upcoming topics in Level 2.

### Conclusion:

The aim of this week is to refine the debugging skills of participants using Chrome Dev Tools. Debugging is an essential skill for developers, and mastering it ensures a smoother coding experience, faster problem resolution, and an overall improved development workflow.
