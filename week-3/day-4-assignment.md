# Assignment: Promises and Async/Await

## Objective

- Understand promises and how to use them.
- Learn how to use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Fetch data from APIs using fetch.
- Use `setTimeout` to handle delays in JavaScript.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Promises

1. **Create and Use a Promise**:
   - Create a `promises.js` file.
   - Create a promise that resolves successfully with a message and log the resolved message.
   - Create a promise that gets rejected and log the error message.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of your `promises.js` file showing the created promises and their usage.

### Part 2: Async/Await

1. **Use Async/Await for Asynchronous Operations**:
   - Create an `asyncAwait.js` file.
   - Create an async function that fetches data from an API and logs the data.
   - Handle any potential errors using try/catch.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of your `asyncAwait.js` file showing the async function and its usage.

### Part 3: Fetching Data from APIs

1. **Fetch Data from an API**:
   - In the `asyncAwait.js` file, create an async function that fetches data from the provided API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1`) and logs the data.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of your `asyncAwait.js` file showing the fetched data from the API.

### Part 4: Using `setTimeout`

1. **Create Delays in Code Execution**:
   - Create a `setTimeout.js` file.
   - Use `setTimeout` to log a message after a delay of 2 seconds.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of your `setTimeout.js` file showing the usage of `setTimeout`.

## Submission

- **GitHub Repository**: Create a repository named `promises-async-await` and push the following:
  - The `promises.js`, `asyncAwait.js`, and `setTimeout.js` files with all the changes.
  - Screenshots of all steps executed.
- **Submission Link**: Submit the URL of your GitHub repository.
