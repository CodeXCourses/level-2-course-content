## Assignment: JS3 Day 4 - Advanced Form Validation in Plant Management System

### Objective

Refine your Plant Management System by integrating advanced form validation. This will ensure that the data entered is valid and enhance the system's robustness and user-friendliness.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Implement Advanced Form Validation

- **Update Your JavaScript Program**:
  - Add validation logic to your `addPlant` function to check for invalid or incomplete input (e.g., empty fields, invalid formats).
  - Implement feedback mechanisms, such as alert messages or inline error messages, to inform users about validation errors.

#### Part 2: Enhance the User Interface

- **Improve the HTML Structure**:
  - Modify your `index.html` to accommodate validation feedback (e.g., add placeholders for error messages).
  - Ensure that the form is user-friendly and guides the user to enter correct information.

#### Part 3: Test and Validate

- **Ensure Robust Validation**:
  - Test the form to ensure that all validation checks are working as expected.
  - Verify that invalid or incomplete data is not added to the plants array or `localStorage`.

#### Part 4: Deployment and Submission

- **Deploy Your Updated Webpage**:

  - Commit and push the updated `index.html` and `script.js` files to your GitHub repository.
  - Redeploy your project on GitHub Pages to reflect the new validation features.

- **Submit Your Updated Work**:
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.

### Rubric

#### Advanced Form Validation - /10

- Complete (10 pts): The form correctly validates all inputs with clear user feedback. Invalid data is not processed or stored.
- Partial (5 pts): Validation is implemented but may miss certain edge cases or lack clear user feedback.
- Limited (0 pts): Validation is poorly implemented, non-existent, or ineffective.

#### Code Quality and Comments - /5

- Complete (5 pts): The code is well-structured, efficiently implements validation, and is well-commented.
- Partial (2 pts): The code functions with minor issues and/or lacks detailed comments.
- Limited (0 pts): The code is poorly structured, inefficient, with no comments.

#### Creativity and UI - /5

- Complete (5 pts): The webpage is creatively designed, with a user-friendly interface that elegantly handles validation feedback.
- Partial (2 pts): The webpage has basic design improvements, but the user interface for validation feedback could be enhanced.
- Limited (0 pts): The webpage lacks creative design elements and a user-friendly interface for validation feedback.
