## Assignment: CSS Day 1 - Pet Adoption Website Landing Page

### Objective

Create the landing page for a Pet Adoption website. This project aims to reinforce your understanding of CSS fundamentals, including the Box Model, selectors, and styling. We will not be using frameworks like Bootstrap for this assignment. This landing page will lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive website developed throughout the week.

### Instructions

- **Create a New Repository**:

  - Name your repository `CSS-Pet-Adoption`.
  - Initialize it with a README, an `index.html` file, and a `styles.css` file.

- **Basic HTML Structure**:
  - In `index.html`, lay out the basic structure of your landing page.
  - Include a top navigation bar, a headline (`h1`) with the name of the pet adoption agency, and two sections for content.

#### Part 2: Styling and Layout

- **CSS Reset**:

  - At the beginning of your `styles.css`, include a CSS reset to ensure consistency across different browsers.

  - Style the CTA using an anchor tag (`<a>`) to look like a button.
  - Implement a hover effect on the CTA for better user interaction.

#### Part 3: Test and Validate

- **Ensure Visual Appeal**:

  - Test your page in different browsers to ensure consistency.
  - Verify that all elements are aligned and properly spaced.
