# JavaScript 3 Teaching Plan - Part 2 - Updated

## Day 1: Constructors and Prototypes

### Hour 1

- Introduction to constructors in JavaScript.
- Creating objects using constructor functions.

### Hour 2

- Understanding prototypes and prototype chains.
- Methods and properties inheritance via prototypes.

### Assignment

- Create a constructor function and add methods using prototypes.

## Day 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

### Hour 1

- Delve into Object-Oriented Programming concepts in JavaScript.
- Discuss classes and objects, encapsulation, and inheritance.

### Hour 2

- Explore JavaScript ES6 classes and syntax.
- Creating classes, methods, and using inheritance.

### Assignment

- Design and implement a simple class hierarchy using JavaScript classes.

## Day 3: Advanced Asynchronous JavaScript

### Hour 1

- Review of Promises and `async/await`.
- Handling errors in asynchronous code.

### Hour 2

- Advanced asynchronous patterns and best practices.
- Explore chaining promises and parallel executions with `Promise.all()`.

### Assignment

- Develop a JavaScript application that involves complex asynchronous operations.

## Day 4: Consuming APIs with JavaScript

### Hour 1

- Introduction to making HTTP requests in JavaScript using `fetch`.
- Working with JSON data from APIs and dynamically updating the DOM.

### Hour 2

- Securing API keys and sensitive data in JavaScript applications. (Won't be able to fully secure the key without a proxy server or some backend logic such as serverless functions, for now just limit the rate of an API or only use free open APIs)
- Practical exercises on integrating real-world APIs into a JavaScript application.

### Assignment

- Create a JavaScript application that consumes a public API, processes the data, and presents it in a user-friendly format.

## Day 5: Bringing It All Together

### Hour 1

- Integrating various JavaScript concepts and techniques in a single project.
- Planning and structuring a more complex JavaScript application.

### Hour 2

- Implementing a mini-project that encapsulates the lessons from the two weeks.
- Encourage creativity and problem-solving.

### Assignment

- Complete the mini-project started in class, ensuring it incorporates key JavaScript concepts learned over the two weeks.

# Continuous Learning

- Encourage students to continue exploring and learning JavaScript beyond the classroom.
- Provide resources for further learning and practice.
