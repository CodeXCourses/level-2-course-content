## Assignment: Postman Day 1 - Introduction to APIs

### Objective

Utilize Postman to send GET requests to the Pokémon API and understand the response structure. This assignment is designed to strengthen your skills in using Postman for API interaction and response analysis.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Sending GET Requests

- **Access the Pokémon API**:

  - Use the Pokémon API endpoint: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/`.
  - This API does not require authentication, making it ideal for practice.

- **Select Three Pokémon**:
  - Choose three different Pokémon for which you want to retrieve data.

#### Part 2: Capture and Document Responses

- **Send GET Requests**:

  - In Postman, send a GET request to the Pokémon API for each of the chosen Pokémon.
  - The request URL will be in the format: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{pokemon_name_or_id}`.

- **Capture Responses**:
  - Observe and understand the JSON response returned by the API.
  - Note the different data points received, such as the Pokémon's abilities, type, and stats.

#### Part 3: Documentation and Submission

- **Prepare Documentation**:

  - Take screenshots of each GET request and the corresponding response in Postman.

- **Update `README.md`**:
  - In your `postman-reflection` repository, create a new section for this assignment.
  - Document each request: include the Pokémon name, request URL, and a brief overview of the response.
  - Embed the screenshots of the requests and responses.
