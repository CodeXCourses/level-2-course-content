## Assignment: Postman Day 2 - Exploring the Weather API

### Objective

Gain hands-on experience with the Weather API by sending requests using Postman. Understand the significance of query parameters in API requests and document the process and findings.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Sending a Request to the Weather API

- **Access the Weather API**:

  - Use the endpoint provided by the Weather API service you signed up for.
  - Ensure your API key is correctly configured in Postman.

- **Set Up Query Parameters**:
  - Include necessary parameters like `q` for location (e.g., a city name or coordinates) and your API key.

#### Part 2: Analyzing and Documenting the Response

- **Send the Request and Observe**:
  - Analyze the JSON response returned by the API. Pay attention to data like temperature, weather conditions, and location details.
  - Note any status codes returned with the response and what they signify.

#### Part 3: Documentation and Reflection

- **Document the Process**:

  - In your `postman-reflection` repository, create a new entry in the `README.md`.
  - Document the request URL, query parameters used, and a summary of the response.
  - Include screenshots of the request setup in Postman and the response received.

- **Reflect on Query Parameters**:
  - Write a brief note on the importance of correct query parameter usage and how it affects the response from the API.
