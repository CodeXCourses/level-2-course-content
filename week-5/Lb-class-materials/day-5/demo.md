### When to Use Thunder Client

- Ideal for quick API tests within the VS Code environment.
- Suitable for individual developers or small projects.
- When working on applications where minimizing resource usage is essential.

### When to Use Postman

- For complex API testing and development workflows.
- In collaborative environments and larger teams.
- When extensive testing and documentation are required.

Thunder Client is a convenient tool for developers who prefer working within VS Code and need a straightforward, efficient way to test APIs. Postman, on the other hand, is more suited for detailed API development and testing, particularly in team settings.

# Day 5, Hour 2: Recap and Q&A on Postman and API Testing

## Q&A Session: Addressing Common Mistakes in API Testing

Now, let's address any questions you may have from this week's lessons. We'll also discuss common mistakes in API testing and how to avoid them.

### Common API Testing Mistakes

- **Overlooking HTTP Status Codes**: Not paying attention to the status codes returned by the API can lead to misunderstanding the response.
- **Ignoring Error Handling**: Failing to test how the API behaves under different error scenarios.
- **Misusing Parameters**: Incorrect use of query and path parameters can lead to faulty requests.
- **Neglecting Security Testing**: Not considering security aspects like authentication and data privacy during testing.
- **Inadequate Documentation**: Forgetting to document the API testing process and findings, which is crucial for future reference and team collaboration.

### Tips to Avoid These Mistakes

- **Pay Attention to Status Codes**: Understand what each status code means and how your API should behave.
- **Implement Thorough Error Checks**: Test for different error responses and ensure proper handling.
- **Understand and Use Parameters Correctly**: Familiarize yourself with the API's required parameters and their correct usage.
- **Conduct Security Testing**: Regularly test for authentication flows and data security.
- **Document Your Work**: Keep a clear record of your testing processes, responses, and observations.

Feel free to ask questions or share any challenges you faced during the week. Let's use this time to clarify and solidify our understanding of Postman and API testing.
