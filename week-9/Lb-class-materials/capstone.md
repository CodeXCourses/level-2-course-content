# Capstone Level 2 Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a 3-page application that showcases advanced web development skills, including API integration, object-oriented programming with JavaScript, and sophisticated styling using SCSS with a 7-1 architecture. The application will consume an API to display meaningful data tailored to the project's theme, ensuring relevance and coherence in its presentation.

## Project Setup

### Repository Name

- `your-repository-name`

### File Structure

- `index.html`
- `style.scss` (with 7-1 structure folders)
- `script.js`
- `README.md`

## Development Log

### Day 1: Project Initialization and API Selection

- Created the project repository and initialized with base files.
- Researched and selected an appropriate API for the project.
- Outlined the application's 3-page structure.

### Day 2: API Integration and Class Implementation

- Implemented the `DataClass` to model API data objects.
- Developed functions for fetching data from the API.
- Started integrating API data into the frontend.

### Day 3: Frontend Development and SCSS Styling

- Designed the UI for all three pages.
- Applied SCSS styling using the 7-1 pattern.
- Tested responsive design.

### Day 4: Finalizing Features and Testing

- Completed all application features.
- Conducted thorough testing for bugs and usability issues.
- Prepared for deployment.

## Deployment

The site is deployed on [GitHub Pages/Netlify] at this URL: `your-deployment-link`

## Presentation Preparation

Outlined the key points to cover during the presentation, focusing on:

- Project concept and API choice.
- Challenges faced and solutions.
- Demonstration of key features.
