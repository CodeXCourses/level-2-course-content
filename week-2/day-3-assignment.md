# Assignment: Flexbox and Forms

## Objective

- Understand basic Flexbox concepts.
- Differentiate between inline and block elements.
- Learn advanced form techniques.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Basic Flexbox Concepts

1. **Create a Flexbox Container**:

   - Create an `index.html` file.
   - Add a container `<div>` element and three child `<div>` elements inside it.
   - Apply Flexbox properties to the container to arrange the child elements in a row.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of your HTML and CSS file content showing the Flexbox setup.

2. **Use Flexbox Properties**:
   - Add CSS to style the Flexbox container and its child elements (e.g., `flex: 1`, `justify-content`, `align-items`).
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of the HTML and CSS file content showing the Flexbox properties applied.

### Part 2: Inline vs. Block Elements

1. **Differentiate Inline and Block Elements**:
   - In your `index.html` file, add examples of inline elements (`<span>`, `<a>`) and block elements (`<div>`, `<p>`).
   - Add CSS to style these elements differently (e.g., background color, margin).
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of the HTML and CSS file content showing the inline and block elements.

### Part 3: Advanced Form Techniques

1. **Create a Form with Advanced Techniques**:

   - Add a form to your `index.html` file with the following elements:
     - Text input with placeholder and autofocus
     - Email input with placeholder and required validation
     - Password input with placeholder and required validation
     - Submit button
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of the HTML file content showing the form elements.

2. **Style the Form Using Flexbox**:

   - Use Flexbox to create a complex layout for the form elements, such as multiple columns.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of the HTML and CSS file content showing the Flexbox form layout.

3. **Enhance Accessibility with ARIA Tags**:
   - Add appropriate ARIA tags to each form element to enhance accessibility.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of the HTML file content showing the ARIA tags.
