# Week 2: Day 5 Assignment - Implementing Form Validation with HTML5 and JavaScript

## Objective

Develop a web form that incorporates both HTML5 and JavaScript validation techniques. This exercise aims to enhance your understanding of form validation, ensuring the correctness and quality of user input.

## Instructions

This assignment involves creating an HTML-only webpage that features a form with robust validation using HTML5 attributes and custom JavaScript.

### Part 1: Creating the Webpage

- **Create a New Repository**:

  - On GitHub, create a new repository named `Form-Validation`.
  - Initialize this repository with a `README.md` file.
  - Clone your new repository to your local machine.

- **Develop the Webpage**:
  - Create an `index.html` file in your repository.
  - Design a form within the webpage that includes:
    - A text input field for a username with JavaScript validation for length (minimum 5 characters).
    - An email input field with both HTML5 and JavaScript regex validation. (Use those Google skills!)
    - Additional input fields of your choice with HTML5 validation (e.g., password, number range, required checkboxes).
    - A submit button.
  - Include comments in the code explaining each form element, its validation purpose, and how the JavaScript validation works.

### Part 2: Adding JavaScript Validation

- **Implement Custom JavaScript Validation**:
  - Add a script tag to your HTML file.
  - Write JavaScript to validate the form fields upon submission, adding to the HTML5 validation.
  - Ensure the form cannot be submitted if any validation fails.

### Part 3: Testing and Validation

- **Test the Form**:
  - Test the form in various scenarios to ensure all validation rules are working as expected.
  - Check the form's behavior when invalid data is entered.

### Part 4: Deployment and Submission

- **Deploy Your Webpage Using GitHub Pages**:

  - In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the GitHub Pages section.
  - Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main`).
  - Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site.
  - Once deployed, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is live.

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.

#### Functionality and Correctness - /15

- **Fully Achieved - 15 pts**

  - The form includes both HTML5 and JavaScript validations.
  - All validations function correctly, preventing form submission on invalid data.
  - JavaScript validations are correctly implemented and complement HTML5 validations.

- **Partially Achieved - 7 pts**

  - The form includes most required validations, but one or two may not function correctly.
  - JavaScript validation is present but may not cover all scenarios.

- **Not Achieved - 0 pts**

  - The form lacks several required validations or they do not function correctly.
  - JavaScript validation is missing, incorrect, or ineffective.

#### Code Clarity and Documentation - /5

- **Fully Achieached - 5 pts**

  - Code is well-organized and cleanly written.
  - Comments are thorough and effectively explain the validations.

- **Partially Achieved - 2 pts**
