# Week 2: Day 4 Assignment - Creating Custom Search Forms for Multiple Search Engines

## Objective

Develop three separate HTML forms, each designed to submit search queries to a different search engine (Google, Bing, and Yahoo). This exercise aims to enhance your understanding of form elements and their interaction with external web services.

## Instructions

This assignment involves developing an HTML-only webpage featuring three distinct forms. Each form should be configured to submit search queries to one of the three specified search engines. The project should be structured and deployed using GitHub Pages.

### Part 1: Creating the Webpage

- **Create a New Repository**:

  - On GitHub, create a new repository named `Multi-Search-Engine-Forms`.
  - Initialize this repository with a `README.md` file.
  - Clone your new repository to your local machine.

- **Develop the Webpage**:
  - Create an `index.html` file in your repository.
  - Design three separate forms within the webpage:
    - One form should submit queries to Google (`https://www.google.com/search`).
    - The second form should target Bing (`https://www.bing.com/search`).
    - The third form should direct queries to Yahoo (`https://search.yahoo.com/search`).
  - Each form should include:
    - A text input field for the search query.
    - A submit button.
  - Configure the `action` and `method` attributes of each form appropriately.
  - Ensure the query input fields have the `name` attribute set correctly (usually `"q"`).
  - Include comments in the code explaining the purpose of each form element and attribute.

### Part 2: Styling the Forms

- **Add Custom Styling**:
  - Style the forms with inline styles
  - Optionally, add a separate CSS file to style your forms, making them visually distinct and appealing.

### Part 3: Deployment and Submission

- **Deploy Your Webpage Using GitHub Pages**:

  - In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the GitHub Pages section.
  - Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`).
  - Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site.
  - Once deployed, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is live.

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.
