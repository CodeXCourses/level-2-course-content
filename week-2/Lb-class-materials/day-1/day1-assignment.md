# Week 2: Day 1 Assignment - Exploring Pre-formatted Text in HTML

## Objective

Develop a deeper understanding of HTML elements, focusing on the use of pre-formatted text and its practical applications in web design.

## Instructions

This assignment involves creating a new GitHub repository, developing an HTML-only webpage that includes specific elements, and deploying it to GitHub Pages. The emphasis is on correctly using basic HTML elements and the `<pre>` tag.

### Part 1: Setting up the Project

- **Create a New Repository**:

  - On GitHub, create a new repository named `HTML-Preformatted-Text`.
  - Initialize this repository with a `README.md` file.
  - Clone your new repository to your local machine.

### Part 2: Webpage Development

- **Develop the HTML Webpage**:

  - Create an `index.html` file in your repository.
  - The webpage should include:
    - An `<h1>` tag for the main title.
    - A `<main>` element containing two `<section>` elements.
    - In the first section:
      - Include a small write-up about what the `<pre>` element is and why it's used.
      - Utilize the `<pre>` tag to show this information in a pre-formatted style.
    - In the second section:
      - Display a snippet of JavaScript code first in a regular `<p>` tag.
      - Then, show the same JavaScript code inside a `<pre>` tag to highlight the difference in formatting.

### Part 3: Deployment and Submission

- **Deploy Your Webpage**:

  - Deploy your webpage using GitHub Pages.
  - Ensure that the live site is accessible.

- **Submit Your Work**:

  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.
