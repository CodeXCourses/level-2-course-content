      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for

      technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
      like JavaScript.

    <title>Introduction to Pre-formatted Text</title>
    <!-- Discuss how the title tag is important for SEO and user experience -->

<body>

    <!-- Begin with an overview of what preformatted text is and its common uses -->
    <h1>Understanding Pre-formatted Text in HTML</h1>

    <!-- Explain the significance of preformatted text for displaying code or text where spacing and formatting are crucial -->
    <p>
        Pre-formatted text is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and the text is preserved exactly as written in the HTML file, including spaces and line breaks.
    </p>

    <!-- Introduce the <pre> tag -->
    <pre>
        // Explain that <pre> tags are useful for displaying code or ASCII art.
        // Mention that inside <pre> tags, text is shown exactly as written in the HTML file.
        /*
        function sayHello() {
            console.log("Hello, world!");
        }
        */

        // ASCII Art Example:
        //   /\
        //  /  \
        // /____\
    </pre>

    <!-- Discuss the difference between preformatted text and normal text formatting -->
    <p>Here is the same code snippet without using preformatted text:</p>
    <p>function sayHello() { console.log("Hello, world!"); }</p>
    
    <!-- Point out how without <pre>, the whitespace and line breaks are not preserved -->

    <!-- Additional use-case: Poetry or other text where line breaks matter -->
    <h2>Poetry with Pre-formatted Text</h2>
    <pre>
        // Discuss how poetry or similar text can maintain its intended formatting with <pre>.
        The Road Not Taken
        by Robert Frost

        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
        And sorry I could not travel both
        And be one traveler, long I stood
        And looked down one as far as I could
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    </pre>

    <!-- End with a summary of when and why to use preformatted text -->
    <!-- Encourage students to consider the readability and purpose of text on their web pages -->
