    <title>ARIA and Web Accessibility</title>
    <!-- The title tag is essential for both web accessibility and SEO. It provides a summary of the page's content and helps users with disabilities understand what the page is about. -->

    <!-- Headings structure the content in a meaningful way, making it easier for screen reader users to navigate through the page. -->
    <h1>Introduction to ARIA and Web Accessibility</h1>

    <!-- Accessibility is about making web content usable by people of all abilities and disabilities. This introduction sets the stage for why ARIA is important. -->
    <p>
      Web accessibility ensures that websites, tools, and technologies are
      designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. ARIA
      helps with this.
    </p>

    <!-- The 'role' attribute explicitly defines the role of an element to assistive technologies. This example shows how a div can be identified as a banner. -->
    <div role="banner">
      <h2>Site Banner</h2>
      <p>This is an example of a banner role used for a website header.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- The 'aria-labelledby' attribute links the ID of another element to label the current element, helping screen readers announce the content more contextually. -->
    <h3 id="section-heading">Accessible Section</h3>
    <div role="region" aria-labelledby="section-heading">
      <p>
        This section is labeled by the heading above, making it easier for
        screen readers to navigate and understand the context.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- The 'aria-hidden' attribute is used to hide elements that aren't relevant to users who rely on screen readers, like decorative content. -->
    <div aria-hidden="true">
      <p>
        This text will be hidden from screen readers, useful for purely
        decorative content or visual elements that don't add informational
        value.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- The 'tabindex' attribute is used to manage keyboard focus. Here, it ensures that the link is focusable, aiding keyboard-only users. -->
    <a href="#" tabindex="0">Accessible Link</a>
    <p>
      Keyboard navigation is crucial for users who can't use a mouse. The
      'tabindex' attribute ensures that elements are reachable using a keyboard.
    </p>

    <!-- Summarizing the importance of ARIA in making web content more accessible and inclusive. -->
    <p>
      ARIA attributes provide essential information to assistive technologies,
      enhancing the web experience for users with disabilities.
    </p>

    <!-- It's important to remind that web accessibility is both an ethical obligation and, in many cases, a legal requirement. Good accessibility practices improve the experience for all users. -->
    <p>
      Remember, following web accessibility guidelines is not only about
      compliance but also about ensuring an inclusive and equitable internet for
      everyone.

    <title>Demonstration of ARIA Tags</title>
    <!-- The <title> tag is crucial for both SEO and accessibility. It gives users and search engines a quick overview of the content of the webpage. -->

    <!-- Heading tags structure the content, making it easier to navigate. Screen readers use these tags to provide a content outline. -->
    <h1>ARIA Tags in Practice</h1>

    <!-- ARIA 'role' attribute: Defines the role of an element to assistive technologies. This helps in conveying the purpose of the element. -->
    <nav role="navigation">
      <!-- The 'navigation' role indicates that this block is a primary navigation section. It helps users with screen readers to quickly find the menu. -->
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>

    <!-- ARIA 'aria-label': Provides an accessible name for an element, particularly useful for screen readers when the element doesn't have visible text. -->
    <input type="search" aria-label="Search site content" />
    <!-- 'aria-label' is essential for input fields, especially when a visible label is not present. This helps screen reader users understand the field's purpose. -->

    <!-- ARIA 'aria-hidden': Hides elements from screen readers. Used for content that's purely decorative or not relevant for users relying on assistive technologies. -->
    <div aria-hidden="true">
      <!-- Use this for elements that don't contribute to the meaning or functionality of the page, like decorative images. -->
      <p>This content is hidden from screen readers.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ARIA 'aria-labelledby': References another element to label the current element. It's beneficial for elements that require more descriptive labeling. -->
    <h2 id="info-section">Information Section</h2>
    <div role="region" aria-labelledby="info-section">
      <!-- 'aria-labelledby' provides a way to associate visible text with an element for screen readers, like labeling a section with a heading. -->
      <p>
        This section is specifically labeled for screen readers using
        'aria-labelledby'.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Emphasize the importance of routinely testing webpages with screen readers and accessibility evaluation tools to ensure a truly accessible user experience. -->
    <!-- Remind that following ARIA practices is not just about meeting standards, but about ensuring that all users have equal access to information and functionality. -->
