    <!-- Introduce the concept of image maps in HTML. -->
    <h1>Introduction to Image Maps in HTML</h1>

    <!-- Explain the purpose and functionality of image maps. -->
    <p>
      Image maps in HTML allow you to make specific areas of an image clickable,
      each linking to different destinations. This feature is useful for
      creating interactive graphics, such as maps or complex diagrams.
    </p>

    <!-- Provide examples of real-world use cases for image maps. -->
    <h2>Real-World Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Interactive maps for tourism websites, allowing users to click on
        landmarks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Diagram-based quizzes where clicking different parts reveals more
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Product images in online stores, where clicking parts of the product
        navigates to detailed descriptions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Suggest creating a visual example in Figma. -->
    <p>
      <strong>Visual Example in Figma:</strong> Create a mockup of an
      interactive map using Figma. Draw shapes over an image where you want
      clickable areas. This helps in planning the coordinates for the HTML image
      map.

    <!-- The 'alt' attribute describes the image, which is essential for accessibility. -->

    <!-- Define the image map with the <map> tag. -->
    <map name="citymap">
      <!-- Define clickable areas using <area> tags with detailed comments. -->

      <!-- Area 1: A popular building or landmark. -->
