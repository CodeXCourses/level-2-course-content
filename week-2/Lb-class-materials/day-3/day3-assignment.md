# Week 2: Day 3 Assignment - Creating an Interactive Image Map

## Objective

Create an HTML webpage featuring an interactive image map. This exercise aims to enhance your understanding of the `<map>` and `<area>` tags and their application in creating clickable regions within an image.

## Instructions

This assignment involves developing an HTML-only webpage that displays an image map with multiple clickable areas. Each area will link to a related image or webpage. The project should be structured and deployed using GitHub Pages.

### Part 1: Creating the Webpage

- **Create a New Repository**:

  - On GitHub, create a new repository named `Interactive-Image-Map`.
  - Initialize this repository with a `README.md` file.
  - Clone your new repository to your local machine.

- **Develop the Webpage**:
  - Choose an image from Unsplash that has multiple distinct items or areas.
  - Create an `index.html` file in your repository.
  - The webpage should include:
    - A heading (`<h1>`) describing the image map.
    - The chosen image from Unsplash.
    - An image map (`<map>` tag) with clickable areas (`<area>` tags).
    - Each clickable area should link to a related image or webpage. This can be a direct link to another image or a separate HTML page featuring the image.
    - Comments in the code explaining the map and area setup.

### Part 2: Testing and Validation

- **Test the Image Map**:
  - Ensure that each clickable area correctly redirects to the intended link.
  - Test the functionality in different browsers to ensure compatibility.

### Part 3: Deployment and Submission

- **Deploy Your Webpage Using GitHub Pages**:

  - In your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the GitHub Pages section.
  - Select the branch you want to deploy (usually `main`).
  - Save the settings and wait for GitHub to deploy your site.
  - Once deployed, GitHub will provide a URL where your site is live.

- **Submit Your Work**:
  - Submit the URL link to your GitHub repository and the live site as your assignment submission.
