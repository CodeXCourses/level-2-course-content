# Assignment: Review HTML Elements and Document Structure

## Objective

- Understand HTML elements and document structure.
- Learn about the PRE tag and its usage.
- Review the box model.
- Compare browser built-in styles with custom styles.

## Instructions

### Part 1: HTML Elements and Structure

1. **Create a Detailed HTML Document**:
   - Create an `index.html` file.
   - Add a basic HTML structure with the following elements:
     - A header with a main title (`<h1>`) and a navigation bar (`<nav>`) containing links (`<a>`).
     - A main section (`<main>`) with at least three sections (`<section>`), each containing a subtitle (`<h2>`) and a paragraph (`<p>`).
     - A footer (`<footer>`) with some text.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of your HTML file content showing the structure.

### Part 2: Introduction to the PRE Tag

1. **Use the PRE Tag**:
   - In one of your sections, add a `<pre>` tag to display preformatted text. Include multiple lines of text with spaces and line breaks.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of the HTML file content showing the `<pre>` tag.

### Part 3: Review of the Box Model

1. **Create and Style a Box**:

   - Add a `<div>` element to one of your sections with some text inside it.
   - Apply CSS styles to this `<div>` to demonstrate the box model, including width, height, padding, border, and margin.
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of your CSS file showing the styles applied.

2. **Screenshot and Explanation**:
   - View your styled `<div>` in a browser.
   - Take a screenshot of the rendered box model.
   - In your README.md file, include the screenshot and a brief explanation of the box model components (content, padding, border, margin).

### Part 4: Browser Built-in Styles vs. Custom Styles

1. **Compare Styles**:
   - Add a paragraph to your HTML file and observe the default styles applied by the browser.
   - Add custom CSS to override the default styles (e.g., change font size, color).
   - **Verification**: Take a screenshot of the HTML and CSS file content showing the overridden styles.

## Submission

- **GitHub Repository**: Create a repository named `html-elements-structure` and push the following:
  - The `index.html` and CSS files with all the changes.
  - Screenshots of all steps executed.
  - README.md with the box model screenshot and explanation.
- **Submission Link**: Submit the URL of your GitHub repository.
